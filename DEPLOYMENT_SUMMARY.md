# n8n Deployment Agent - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the deployment infrastructure created for the n8n project. The deployment agent has taken full ownership of deployment, testing, and operational procedures.

---

## What Was Created

### 1. Deployment Scripts (`scripts/`)

#### `scripts/deploy.sh` ✅
**Idempotent deployment script with automatic rollback**

**Features:**
- Pre-flight validation (Docker, env files, required variables)
- Automatic backup before deployment
- Pull latest images and deploy
- Health check validation (60s timeout)
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Cleanup old backups (keeps last 10)
- Colored logging and detailed output

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh              # Deploy
./scripts/deploy.sh --rollback   # Rollback to last backup
./scripts/deploy.sh --help       # Show help
```

**Exit Codes:**
- `0` = Success
- `1` = Failure (auto-rollback performed)

---

#### `scripts/integration-tests.sh` ✅
**Comprehensive post-deployment validation suite**

**15 Integration Tests:**
1. Container running status
2. Container health status
3. HTTP endpoint reachability
4. /healthz endpoint validation
5. Basic authentication enforcement
6. API endpoint accessibility
7. Volume persistence check
8. Resource usage monitoring (CPU/Memory)
9. Container logs error scan
10. Network connectivity validation
11. Webhook URL configuration
12. Port binding verification
13. Environment variables validation
14. Container restart policy check
15. Response time measurement

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/integration-tests.sh
```

**Output:**
- Colored test results (PASS/FAIL)
- Success rate percentage
- Detailed results saved to `test-results.log`

---

#### `scripts/backup.sh` ✅
**Automated backup with retention policy**

**Backs Up:**
- Environment configuration (`.env`)
- Docker Compose configuration
- Dockerfile
- n8n data volume (workflows, credentials, executions)
- SQLite database (if accessible)
- Container image information

**Features:**
- Timestamped backups
- 30-day retention policy
- Backup metadata and size tracking
- Last backup reference saved

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/backup.sh              # Create backup
./scripts/backup.sh list         # List backups
./scripts/backup.sh cleanup      # Remove old backups
```

---

#### `scripts/restore.sh` ✅
**Interactive and automated restore functionality**

**Features:**
- Interactive mode (select from list)
- Restore specific backup by path
- Restore latest backup
- Confirmation prompts
- Stops current deployment safely
- Restores all data and configuration
- Validates successful restoration

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/restore.sh                    # Interactive
./scripts/restore.sh --latest           # Restore latest
./scripts/restore.sh /path/to/backup    # Restore specific
```

---

### 2. CI/CD Pipelines (`.github/workflows/`)

#### `.github/workflows/test.yml` ✅
**Continuous Integration pipeline**

**Triggers:**
- Pull requests to main/master
- Pushes to non-main branches
- Daily schedule (2 AM UTC)

**Jobs:**
1. **Lint** - Validates Docker configs and shell scripts
2. **Build** - Builds Docker image with caching
3. **Integration Test** - Full test suite with artifacts
4. **Security Scan** - Trivy vulnerability scanning
5. **Deployment Test** - Validates all deployment scripts
6. **Report** - Generates test summary

**Features:**
- Parallel job execution
- Test result artifacts (7-day retention)
- Security SARIF upload to GitHub Security
- Comprehensive test summary

---

#### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` ✅
**Continuous Deployment pipeline**

**Triggers:**
- Push to main/master
- Manual workflow dispatch (with environment selection)

**Jobs:**
1. **Test** - Runs integration tests in CI
2. **Build** - Builds and pushes Docker image to registry
3. **Deploy** - SSH deployment to server with automated script
4. **Notify** - Sends deployment status notifications

**Features:**
- Multi-environment support (production/staging/development)
- Automated SSH deployment
- Post-deployment validation
- Rollback capability
- Notification hooks (ready for Slack/Discord/Email)

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`

## Deployment Workflow

### Local/Manual Deployment

```bash
1. Configure environment
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Set HOST_IP, credentials

2. Deploy
   ./scripts/deploy.sh

3. Validate
   ./scripts/integration-tests.sh

4. Access n8n
   http://YOUR_HOST_IP:5678
```

### CI/CD Deployment

```bash
1. Configure GitHub Secrets
   (See .github/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md)

2. Push to main branch
   git push origin main

3. GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Runs tests
   - Builds Docker image
   - Deploys to server
   - Runs post-deployment tests
   - Sends notifications
```

---

## Testing & Validation

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback
Deploy script automatically rolls back if:
- Health check fails after deployment
- Container fails to start
- Deployment script encounters errors

### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to last deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh --rollback

# Or restore specific backup
./scripts/restore.sh /path/to/backup
```

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily Tasks
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Run health checks
./scripts/integration-tests.sh

# Monitor resources
docker stats n8n
```

### Weekly Tasks
```bash
# List backups
./scripts/backup.sh list

# Create manual backup
./scripts/backup.sh

# Check for updates
docker-compose pull
```

### Monthly Tasks
```bash
# Test restore procedure
./scripts/restore.sh --latest

# Review security logs
docker-compose logs | grep -i "auth\|error"

# Update credentials (if needed)
nano .env && docker-compose restart
```

```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs

# Validate configuration
docker-compose config

# Manual rollback
./scripts/deploy.sh --rollback
```

### Tests fail
```bash
# View detailed results
cat test-results.log

# Check container health
docker inspect n8n | grep -A 10 Health

# Verify connectivity
curl http://localhost:5678/healthz
```

### Backup issues
```bash
# List backups
./scripts/backup.sh list

# Create manual backup
./scripts/backup.sh

# Verify backup contents
ls -lh backups/backup_*/
```
